# Weather Stations

In 2020 and 2021 the Genomes to Fields weather station was installed adjacent to the growout of the Wisconsin Diversity panel. In 2020 the install of the weather station was delayed until mid June as a result of the pandemic.

# Alternative is to pull weather data from nearby permanent station. 

I need more info on this to help people do it.
