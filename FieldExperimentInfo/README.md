# Overview

This directory contains (or will eventually contain) weather data, field maps, soil test data, etc for grow outs of the Bugeater experiment conducted by the Schnable and Thompson labs in Nebraska and Michigan respectively.

## Nebraska 2020

At randomized complete block design consisting of two blocks of 840 plots each (1,680 plots total). A total of 752 genotypes from the Wisconsin diversity panel were included in this field experiment, with the remaining plots within each block consisting of a single repeated check (B97). Field evaluation of B97 plots suggested the stock may have been increased from a contaminated source.

The field was located at approximate coordinates of (40.852 N, 96.616 W) at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Havelock Farm. Planting occurred on May 6th, 2020. Rows were planted on an east-west axis with the "1000s" replicate on the west side of the field and the "2000s" replicate on the east side of the field. Plot 1001 was located in the north west corner of the field.

Each plot consisted of two parallel rows 7.5 feet/2.29 meters long with 30 inches/76 centimeters between parallel rows and 4.5 inch/11.5 centimeter spacing between sequential plants in the same row.

## Nebraska 2021

At randomized complete block design consisting of two blocks of 840 plots each (1,680 plots total).

The field was located at approximate coordinates of (40.859 N, 96.596 W) at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln’s Havelock Farm. Planting occurred on May 7th, 2021. Rows were planted on an north-south axis with the "1000s" replicate on the south side of the field and the "2000s" replicate on the north side of the field. Plot 1001 was located in the south west corner of the field.

Each plot consisted of two parallel rows 7.5 feet/2.29 meters long with 30 inches/76 centimeters between parallel rows and 4.5 inch/11.5 centimeter spacing between sequential plants in the same row.

## Michigan 2020

Planted two reps of 761 genotypes from the Wisconsin diversity panel. Note that the Michigan field does not include a repeated check line.

The field was located in East Lansing, Michigan and the previous crop (2019) was soybeans. The field was planted on May 25th, 2020.

Each plot consisted of two parallel rows 10 feet/3.05 meters long with 30 inches/76 centimeters between parallel rows and 6 inch/15.2 centimeter spacing between sequential plants in the same row.


## Michigan 2021
