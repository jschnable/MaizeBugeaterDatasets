# Summary

Prepublication metabolomics data generated from the Nebraska 2020 field experiment (see FieldExperimentInfo).

Data were generated from a parallel set of samples collected at the same time and from the same leaves on the same plants as the Nebraska 2020 RNA-seq samples. Includes information from 660 genotypes and 27 unique metabolites. Metabolites were quantified using GC-MS and peak indensities were normalized to the fresh weight used for each sample. For this reason the data can be used to compare the contents of particular metabolites across samples, but should not be used to abundance the abundance of different metabolites within a single sample. 

Metabolomics data was generated by Prof. Toshihiro Obata and Connor Pedersen, a research technologist within the Obata lab.

We observed significant batch effects within this data, please use at your own risk.
