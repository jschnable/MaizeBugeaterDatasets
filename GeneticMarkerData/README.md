# Sources of Genetic Marker Data For GWAS

Please download data for 16,634,049 segregating genetic markers with a minor allele frequency greater than 5% among 752 maize lines from the Wisconsin Diversity panel [from Dryad](https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.16123). The relevant file is WiDiv.vcf.gz and the SNPs are called relative to the B73 RefGen v5 reference genome.
