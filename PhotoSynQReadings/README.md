# Data Collection Procedure

Measurements in 2020 were collected during the day. Measurements in 2021 were collected at night.

## Nebraska Nebraska2021MultiSpeQNight

Measurements were collected over three days in August of 2021: the 6th, 7th, and 9th. A gap exists between the second and third day of data collection because of rainfall that made the field too muddy to access.

Measurements began at least one hour after sunset. Researchers used green headlamps in the field.

Three repeated measurements were collected per plot.
