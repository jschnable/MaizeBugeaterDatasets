# Summary

These are prepublication data collected two efforts, one (2021) coordinated by Fangyi Li, a PhD student co-advised by Profs. Rebecca Roston and James C. Schnable and a second (2020) coordinated by Seema Sahay, a postdoctoral scholar advised by Katarzyna Glowacka.

# Data Collection Procedure

Measurements in 2020 were collected during the day. Measurements in 2021 were collected at night.

## Nebraska2020MultiSpeQPostflowering

Measurements were collected over three days after the peak of flowering, July 23rd 24th, and 28th.

On each day all or the majority of plots were measured once, so all of the majority of plots should be represented three times in the dataset from measurements on different days.

## Nebraska2021MultiSpeQNight

Measurements were collected over three days in August of 2021: the 6th, 7th, and 9th. A gap exists between the second and third day of data collection because of rainfall that made the field too muddy to access.

Measurements began at least one hour after sunset. Researchers used green headlamps in the field.

Three repeated measurements were collected per plot but the three measurements were collected sequentially so all or most plots will only be observed on one of the three nights.

# Authors

The 2020 experiment was lead by Dr. Seema Sahay with input from Dr. Marcin Grzybowski. Dr. Sahay's advisor is Prof. Katarzyna Glowacka. Dr. Grzybowski's advisor is James Schnable.

Annie Nelson, Bailey McLean, Rachel Gerdes, Ravi Tross, Michael Tross, Mackenzie Zweiner, Marcin Gryzbowski and Seema Sahay all worked to collect sensor data in the summer of 2020.

The 2021 experiment was lead by Fangyi Li. Her advisors are Prof. Rebecca Roston and James Schnable.

Jonathan Turkus, Marcin Grzybowski, Hongyu Jin, Michael Tross, Aline Rodrigues de Queiroz and Thien Thao Ngoc Pham all worked through multiple nights in 2021 to collect sensor data.
