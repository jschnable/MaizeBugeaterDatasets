# Sample Collection

## Nebraska 2020

Samples were collected from the "1000s" replicate of the 2020 Nebraska Bugeater field experiment between 9 AM and 11 AM on July 8th, 2020. In each plot, a single representative plant was selected and five leaf discs were sampled from a fully expanded/mature leaf.

## Nebraska 2021

Samples were collected from the "XXXXs" replicate of the 2021 Nebraska Bugeater field experiment between 9 AM and 11 AM on July 8th, 2021. In each plot, a single representative plant was selected and five leaf discs were sampled from a fully expanded/mature leaf.

# Sample Preparation

## Nebraska 2020

Samples were extracted using ... protocol from Jon.

## Nebraska 2021 and Michigan 2021

Samples were extracted by Psomagen using ... kit.

# Sequencing

For each RNA sample a single stranded mRNA TruSeq library was constructed. Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 S4 with 2x150 base pair reads, and a target average of 40M reads per sample. Sequencing was conducted by Psomagen.

# Raw Sequence Data

Each RNA sample has been or will be deposited into the NCBI SRA. Details to be added when this occurs.

# Expression Quantification

Genome version. Software. Settings. This work was conducted by Vladimir Torres Rodriguez.
